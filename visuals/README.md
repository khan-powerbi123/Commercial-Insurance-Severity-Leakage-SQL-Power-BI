# Power BI Dashboard – Commercial Insurance Severity & Leakage

This folder contains Power BI visualizations built using SQL outputs from the Severity & Leakage Case Study.

Each page represents a different “Clue” in the analysis process:
1. Claim Risk Drivers (Rate Trends, Reserves, Leakage)
2. Adjuster Performance & Severity
3. Notes & Leakage Flags
4. Executive Roll-ups & KPIs

📊 Power BI insights visualize the risk signals detected in SQL:
- **Severity** patterns by adjuster and state  
- **Leakage** indicators (missed subrogation, late FNOL, duplicate billing)  
- **Profitability** trends across line of business and region
