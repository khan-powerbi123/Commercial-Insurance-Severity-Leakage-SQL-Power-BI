# Commerical Insurance Severity & Leakage - (SQL Case Study + Power BI Visuals)

**Overview**  
End-to-end T-SQL: staged â†’ core â†’ mart. Finds **severity QoQ** hotspots, **reserve-leakage** flags, **vendor IQR** outliers, notes-based red flags (missed subrogation, late FNOL), and a final **risk-score view**.

**Why itâ€™s useful**  
â€¢ Real insurance scenarios (leakage, reserves, subrogation, late FNOL)  
â€¢ Clear run order + small sample outputs for quick review  
â€¢ Uses **window functions** (LAG, ROW_NUMBER, PERCENTILE_CONT), **recursive CTE**, **GROUPING SETS**

  
**Quick links**  
â€¢ [`sql/`](sql) â€“ scripts in run order  
â€¢ [`results/`](results) â€“ sql outputs in CSV samples  
â€¢ [`visuals/`](visuals) â€“ Power BI Visuals

## ðŸ“Š Power BI Dashboard Overview  
This Power BI report builds directly on the SQL case study results, transforming the extracted insights into interactive visual dashboards for executive and analytical review.  

Each dashboard page represents a different analytical *Clue* in the end-to-end risk and leakage detection process.

| Page | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **1. Claim Risk Drivers** | Shows rate change trends, reserve adequacy by state and LOB, leakage scoring, and vendor outlier detection using IQR. |
| **2. Adjuster Performance** | Highlights adjuster-level claim severity patterns and workload distribution. Identifies clusters of high-severity adjusters. |
| **3. Leakage Flags Analysis** | Visualizes missed subrogation, late FNOL, and duplicate billing impact across claims. |
| **4. Executive Roll-ups & KPIs** | Summarizes total incurred losses by Line of Business and State with executive insights and trend commentary. |
